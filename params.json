It brings users two things: a set of scripts/lists of interesting software ; an iso, ready to install.\r\n\r\n### History\r\n\r\nIts name came from [cs.edu Slax](http://charybde.homeunix.org/~schmitz/slax-csedu/), a distro that stopped in 2007. A dire need for a ready-to program distribution to install on computers in the University of Nantes started the project.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n2014, Pierre-Antoine Rault (@rigelk)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
